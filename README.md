# CryptoKittiesNFTDapp
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ BEFORE USING THIS CODE!
## This project is build and tested on the ETH testnet running on local testnet node, through it meet the creteria to do so but it was not meant to be use as production code as is.  Therefore severval things that most likely to need more work on such as:  
## 1) contract seed phrase are not save in the .secret file and are exposed in the truffle-config.js
## 2) codes have not been tested for vlunability by 3rd parties, and probably need more work in security and vulnerability exploits protections
## 3) I'm not a designer so I used a lot of pre-made templates for the visuals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## The aim of this project is to gain expereience in developing a fullstack Decentralised App (dApp) from scratch, by cloning Cryptokitties and making an NFT marketplace for it.
## To make the most out of this I've developed most of the code myself, while using as little existing templates and styling library as possible. When project is completed I used some pre-made html & css templates to particition the site and to make it website more visally ecstatic to showcase the final product of what I've made
## The ERC contracts are ERC720, ERC721 and ERC163 compliant, as the contracts is build upon the standard IERC (ERC interface).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
# This project is divded into several phrases, which are:
## 1. Develop the frontend (html, css, javascript)
## 2. Develop the backend which encludes:
###    i) Minting the kitty as NFTs (ERC721)
###    ii) Cross breeding between kitties to generate new kittes, i.e. interactions between ERC721s via smart contract
###    iii) Buying and selling of the said NFT on the ETH network via smart contract (ERC720 compliant)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# I made this crypto-kitties clone project that works on the Ethereum (ETH) network to gain working experience working with:
## 1. making NFTs that is compatible with industry standards namely ERC721
## 2. throughoutly understands and able to work with ERC720 and ERC721 standards
## 3. web3 development using html, css, javascript

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Although this project is build on the ETH network, but the logic are translateable to other EVM compatible chains, as well as other chains that has smart contracts and NFTs avaliable.
