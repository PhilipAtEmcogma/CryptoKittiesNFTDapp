# CryptoKittiesNFTDapp
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## The aim of this project is to gain expereience in developing a fullstack Decentralised App (dApp) from scratch, by cloning Cryptokitties and making an NFT marketplace for it.
## To make the most out of this I've developed most of the code myself, while using as little existing templates and styling library as possible. Then after project is completed I used some pre-frabricated html & css templated to make the website more visibally ecstatic
## The ERC contracts are both ERC721 and ERC163 compatiable according to the standards by using the standard IERC (ERC interface).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
# This project is divded into several phrases, which are:
## 1. Develop the frontend (html, css, javascript)
## 2. Develop the backend which encludes:
###    i) Minting the kitty as NFTs (ERC721)
###    ii) Cross breeding between kitties to generate new kittes, i.e. interactions between ERC721s via smart contract
###    iii) Buying and selling of the said NFT on the ETH network via smart contract (ERC720 compatiable)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# I made this crypto-kitties clone project that works on the Ethereum (ETH) network to gain working experience working with:
## 1. making NFTs that is compatible with industry standards namely ERC721
## 2. throughoutly understands and able to work with ERC720 and ERC721 standards
## 3. web3 development using html, css, javascript

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Although this project is build on the ETH network, but the logic are translateable to other EVM compatible chains, as well as other chains that has smart contracts and NFTs avaliable.
